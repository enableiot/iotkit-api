# iotkit-api

Hello. 

This is the primary repository for the [enableiot.com](https://dashboard.us.enableiot.com) external API services. 

See our [wiki for the REST API documentation](https://github.com/enableiot/iotkit-api/wiki/Api-Home) and [sample code](https://github.com/enableiot/iotkit-samples/tree/master/api) which uses the API. Some API commands are available via [MQTT](MQTT.md).

Or, you can use the [iotkit-agent](https://github.com/enableiot/iotkit-agent) to focus on application development and simplify some complexities of cloud connectivity.

Happy coding!
